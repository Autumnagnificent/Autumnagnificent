# Hello!

I'm Autumn, a hobby programmer, game-developer, and Teardown modder; I've worked on a plethora of *things*....

But the best of the *things* I've worked on are pinned below.

I was former member of the Teardown modding community, what I am most well known for. I've since left that community, my published work can be viewed on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Autumnagnificent/myworkshopfiles/), and I have a [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z92r3EPguAW1my4Wp3Y7ewG43NyjqaiP) containing my all of m work, a video showing 4 years of work, and a accompanied message.
