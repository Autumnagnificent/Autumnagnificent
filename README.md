# Hello!

I've made all the stuff you see below;
I'm a hobby-programmer, game-developer, artist, video editor, and other related titles.

I am a former well-known member of the Teardown modding community. After 4 years, I've since moved on; my published work can be viewed on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Autumnagnificent/myworkshopfiles/), and I have a [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z92r3EPguAW1my4Wp3Y7ewG43NyjqaiP) containing my all of my unreleased work, a [timeline video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHPUbTQcOMM), and a personal message where I talk about my time within the community, my experiences, and how it has effected me going froward.

My resources and utilities I made for Teardown are still available below as well.
